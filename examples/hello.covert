Agency {
    "hello",
    employs "Random",
    employs "Terminal",
}

? this is a comment

? variables
suspect name <= Terminal.input("What is your name?")
suspect age <= Random.randint(1, 100)

? iteration works with an agent and a stakeout
agent countdown expects i {
    Terminal.print(i)
}
stakeout [1,2,3,4] countdown

? conditionals
investigate ( age > 60 ) then {
    Terminal.print("You are old")
} fallback {
    Terminal.print("You are young")
}
